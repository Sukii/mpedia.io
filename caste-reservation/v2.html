<h1>Viewpoint-2</h1>
<p>Caste-based reservation creates caste inequality in meritocracy-based evaluation system, resulting in poor quality of services and political developments.</p>
<h1>Manusmriti in Practice</h1>
<p>The Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text, is one of the earliest sources of Hindu law and social customs. It outlines principles governing societal organization, including the caste system, which stratifies society into four main varnas or classes: Brahmins (priests and scholars), Kshatriyas (warriors and rulers), Vaishyas (traders and agriculturists), and Shudras (servants and laborers). The text also prescribes social norms and duties based on one's caste.</p>
<ul>
<li>Caste System: Manusmriti is often cited as one of the foundational texts that codified and perpetuated the caste system in India. According to Manusmriti, a person's caste is determined by birth, and individuals are expected to adhere to specific duties and occupations prescribed for their caste.</li>
<li>Hierarchy and Discrimination: Manusmriti assigns higher status and privileges to individuals belonging to higher castes while relegating those in lower castes to menial tasks and social ostracization. Discrimination based on caste, therefore, is deeply ingrained in societal practices influenced by Manusmriti.</li>
<li>Contemporary Influence: Despite being an ancient text, Manusmriti continues to exert influence on social norms and practices in some communities. Caste-based discrimination, untouchability, and restrictions on inter-caste interactions persist in certain parts of India, reflecting Manusmriti's enduring legacy.</li>
<li>Criticism and Reinterpretation: Manusmriti has been criticized for its endorsement of social hierarchies and inequalities. Many modern scholars and activists advocate for a reinterpretation of Hindu scriptures, including Manusmriti, in light of contemporary values of equality, justice, and human rights.</li>
<li>Legal Status: While Manusmriti holds historical and cultural significance, it does not have the same legal standing as the Indian Constitution. India's legal system is based on a secular and democratic framework, and laws are subject to constitutional scrutiny, irrespective of their religious or historical origins.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while reservation policies in India aim to promote social justice and inclusivity, Manusmriti, with its historical influence, continues to cast a shadow on societal practices, perpetuating caste-based discrimination and inequalities. Bridging the gap between reservation in theory and Manusmriti in practice requires concerted efforts to challenge entrenched biases and promote a more equitable and inclusive society.</p>
<h1>Moral Justification</h1>
<p>Moral justifications for Manusmriti-based practices are challenging due to its inherent perpetuation of social hierarchies and discrimination based on birth. However, some proponents argue that Manusmriti provides a framework for maintaining social order and stability within traditional Hindu society. They contend that adherence to Manusmriti's principles upholds cultural continuity and preserves ancient traditions that are integral to Hindu identity. Additionally, proponents may assert that Manusmriti's teachings promote discipline, morality, and the fulfillment of societal duties, albeit within a hierarchical framework. Nevertheless, these justifications are contested by critics who argue that Manusmriti's caste-based prescriptions undermine fundamental principles of equality, justice, and human dignity.</p>
