<h1>Viewpoint-1</h1>
<p>Caste-based reservation in jobs is required to offset the preexisting inequality in the Indian society to uplift the lower castes.</p>
<h1>Reservation in Paper</h1>
<p>Reservation in India refers to the practice of setting aside a certain percentage of seats or positions in educational institutions, government bodies, and public sector undertakings for historically marginalized communities. The reservation policy aims to address historical injustices and promote social equality by providing opportunities to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC).</p>
<p><strong>Constitutional Provisions:</strong> The reservation system is enshrined in the Indian Constitution under Articles 15(4), 16(4), and 46. These articles empower the state to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Framework:</strong> Over the years, various laws and amendments have been enacted to operationalize reservation policies. The most notable among them is the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, which provides protection against discrimination and violence faced by marginalized communities.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Reservation quotas vary across different sectors. For example, in education, reservation percentages typically range from 7.5% to 50% in government-funded institutions. Similarly, in government jobs, reservations can range from 7.5% to 27% depending on the category of candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> The primary objectives of reservation policies include promoting social justice, reducing inequality, and empowering historically marginalized communities by providing them with access to education, employment, and representation in decision-making bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Criticism and Debates:</strong> Reservation policies have faced criticism on various grounds, including concerns about reverse discrimination, inefficiency in uplifting the intended beneficiaries, and perpetuation of identity politics. However, proponents argue that reservations are necessary to address deep-rooted inequalities and promote diversity and inclusivity.</p>
<h1>Moral Justification</h1>
<p>Reservation policies are morally justified as they aim to rectify historical injustices inflicted upon marginalized communities who have been systematically oppressed for generations. By providing affirmative action measures, reservation policies seek to create a more equitable society where individuals have equal opportunities to succeed based on their abilities rather than their social background. These policies promote social justice by addressing systemic discrimination and ensuring that all members of society have access to education, employment, and other opportunities. Embracing diversity through reservation fosters empathy, understanding, and social cohesion, enriching the cultural fabric of society. Upholding principles of equality and fairness necessitates proactive measures like reservation to dismantle entrenched inequalities and empower marginalized groups.</p>
